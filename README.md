# What's this?

Me trying to do the [flux-challenge](https://github.com/staltz/flux-challenge) in present-day Elm.

# How do I check this out?

Clone the [flux-challenge](https://github.com/staltz/flux-challenge) and run their webserver as described in their repo.

Clone this repo and run:

```
elm package install
elm reactor
```

Open the displayed url in your browser, click `index.html`.

# Is this 100%?

Nope, check [todo.txt](./todo.txt)

# Why not clone their repo and submit this?

They ain't accepting PRs anymore so there's no point
